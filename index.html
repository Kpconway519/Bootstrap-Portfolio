                            My name is Kevin Conway and I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently enrolled in the Web Development Bootcamp at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. Once I complete this course, I will have the skills necessary to be a junior web developer.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2014, I graduated from Mississippi State University with a Bachelor's in History.  I am currently employed at Williams Buick GMC as a Sales Professional. In total, I have been working in sales for almost three and a half years.
                        </p>
                
                        <p>
                            I feel that my background in sales as well as my education make me an ideal candidate for a web developer position. My history degree required a great deal of research and instilled in me powerful critical thinking and problem solving skills, an appreciation for proper documentation, and a recognition of the power of clear and concise presentation. As a salesman, I have to be persuasive, match my product with customers' needs, and collaborate with many different parties to structure a successful deal. In my spare time, I read sales books, record myself speaking, and otherwise work on improving my sales skills. I am always working on becoming a better person, and for that reason, as well as all the above reasons, I believe I would be an ideal web developer. You can see samples of my work through the "Portfolio" link above, and you can get in touch with me by submitting your info through "Contact" above.
